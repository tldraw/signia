# How to contribute

## Contributing to the docs

We generate part of our documentation from the TSDoc comments in our source code, and the rest is written by hand in `/docs`.

To start the docs dev server, run

`pnpm start-docs` in the root of the repo

## Contributing to the Signia library

If you want to contribute a small fix or a small feature, feel free to just submit a PR.

If you're not sure whether we will want the feature, or if it's a larger feature, please get in touch with us on discord or github to check that it makes sense to work on it first.

## Deployment

The docs are deployed automatically after merging into main.

New versions of the package are deployed manually by triggering a github action.
