**Signia** is a minimal, fast, and [scalable](/docs/scalability) signals library for TypeScript. It is framework-agnostic, and has official React bindings.

Signia was originally created for [tldraw](https://beta.tldraw.com), to meet performance demands that other reactive signals libraries could not.
