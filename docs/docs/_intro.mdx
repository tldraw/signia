**Signia** is a minimal, fast, and scalable signals library for TypeScript. It is framework-agnostic, and has official React bindings.

It uses a new clock-based lazy reactivity system that allows signals to scale with complex data-intensive applications.

Signia was originally created for [tldraw](https://beta.tldraw.com), to meet performance demands that other reactive signals libraries could not.
