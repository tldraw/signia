# Incrementally computed signals

One of Signia's superpowers is its support for incremental recomputation of derived values.
This makes it possible to work with large derived collections extremely efficiently, while still benefitting from the lazy evaluation and always-on caching that Signia provides.

This is achieved using a clock-based reactivity system.

## Clocks and Epochs

Signia has a global logical **clock**. This is an integer that gets incremented every time any atom is updated.

An **epoch** is one specific value of the global clock. It is a virtual point in time.

You can access the epoch upon which a signal's value last changed using the `lastChangedEpoch` property:

```ts
const firstName = atom('firstName', 'Brian')
const startEpoch = firstName.lastChangedEpoch
firstName.set('Steve')
const endEpoch = firstName.lastChangedEpoch
console.log(endEpoch - startEpoch) // 1
```

When a derived value is computed, its computing function is passed two arguments:

- `previousValue` the last value returned by the computing function
- `lastComputedEpoch` the value of the global clock when the previous value was last _computed_.

  :::note
  Beware that 'last computed' is not the same as 'last changed', since a value can be recomputed and end up the same as it was before.
  :::

`lastComputedEpoch` can be used in conjunction with the `Signal.getDiffSince` method to retrieve a list of changes, or **diffs**, since the last time the computing function was invoked.

## Diffs don't come free

JavaScript's datatypes don't have built-in support for diffs, so you need to implement this functionality manually.

For this tutorial, let's use [`immer`](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), which is a library for working with immutable data.
It has the ability to extract diffs while making changes using its `produceWithPatches` function.

Here is an example of an Atom wrapper which uses `immer` to capture diffs:

```ts
import { Patch, produceWithPatches, enablePatches } from 'immer'
import { Atom, atom } from 'signia'

enablePatches()

class ImmerAtom<T> {
	// The second Atom type parameter is the type of the diff
	readonly atom: Atom<T, Patch[]>
	constructor(name: string, initialValue: T) {
		this.atom = atom(name, initialValue, {
			// In order to store diffs, we need to provide the `historyLength` argument
			// to the atom constructor. Otherwise it will not allocate a history buffer.
			historyLength: 10,
		})
	}

	update(fn: (draft: T[]) => void) {
		const [nextValue, patches] = produceWithPatches(this.atom.value, fn)
		this.atom.set(nextValue, patches)
	}
}
```

## Using diffs in `computed`

We can use the diffs emitted by our ImmerAtom in our `computed` functions.

Let's define an incremental version of Array.map:

```ts
import { Draft } from 'immer'
import { RESET_VALUE, withDiff } from 'signia'

function map<T, U>(source: ImmerAtom<T[]>, fn: (value: T) => U): Computed<U[], Patch[]> {
	return computed(
		source.atom.name + ':mapped',
		(prev, lastComputedEpoch) => {
			// we need to check whether this is the first time we're running
			if (isUninitialized(prev)) {
				// if so, just map over the array and return it
				return source.atom.value.map(fn)
			}

			// this is not the first time we're running, so we need to calculate the diff of the source atom
			const diffs = source.atom.getDiffSince(lastComputedEpoch)
			// if there is not enough history to calculate the diff, this will be the RESET_VALUE constant
			if (diffs === RESET_VALUE) {
				// in which case we need to start over
				return source.atom.value.map(fn)
			}

			// we have diffs and a previous value
			const [next, patches] = produceWithPatches(prev, (draft) => {
				// apply the upstream diffs while generating a new set of downstream diffs
				for (const patch of diffs.flat()) {
					const index = patch.path[0]
					if (typeof index !== 'number') {
						// this will be array length changes
						draft[patch.path[0] as 'length'] = patch.value as number
						continue
					}
					if (patch.op === 'add') {
						if (patch.path.length === 0) {
							// this is a new item in the array, we need to splice it in and call the map function on it
							draft.splice(patch.path[0] as number, 0, fn(patch.value) as Draft<U>)
						} else {
							// one of the existing items in the array has changed deeply
							// let's call the map function on the new value
							draft[index] = fn(source.atom.value[index]) as Draft<U>
						}
					} else if (patch.op === 'replace') {
						// one of the existing items in the array has been fully replaced
						draft[index] = fn(patch.value) as Draft<U>
					} else if (patch.op === 'remove') {
						next.splice(index, 1)
					}
				}
			})

			// withDiff is a helper function that returns a special value that tells Signia to use the
			// provided value and diff
			return withDiff(next, patches)
		},
		{
			historyLength: 10,
		}
	)
}
```

You're probably thinking: "that's a whole lot of code just to map over an array!"

Alas, incremental logic is _much_ trickier to write than non-incremental logic. But often the payoff is worth it.

## The payoff

Let's define a list of names and a computed value that reverses them:

```ts
const names = new ImmerAtom('names', ['Steve', 'Alex', 'Lu', 'Jamie', 'Mitja'])

let numReverseCalls = 0
const reversedNames = map(names, (name) => {
	numReverseCalls++
	return name.split('').reverse().join('')
})

console.log(reversedNames.value) // [ 'evetS', 'xelA', 'uL', 'eimaJ', 'ajtiM' ]
console.log(numReverseCalls) // 5
```

Now if we push a new name into the list, we can see that the 'reverse' function is only called once more:

```ts
names.update((draft) => {
	draft.push('David')
})

console.log(reversedNames.value) // [ 'evetS', 'xelA', 'uL', 'eimaJ', 'ajtiM', 'divaD' ]
console.log(numReverseCalls) // 6
```

And similarly, if we update an existing name, the 'reverse' function is only called once more:

```ts
names.update((draft) => {
	draft[0] = 'Sunil'
})

console.log(reversedNames.value) // [ 'linuS', 'xelA', 'uL', 'eimaJ', 'ajtiM', 'divaD' ]
console.log(numReverseCalls) // 7
```

And finally, if we pop a name off the list, the 'reverse' function is not even called!

```ts
names.update((draft) => {
	draft.pop()
})

console.log(reversedNames.value) // [ 'linuS', 'xelA', 'uL', 'eimaJ', 'ajtiM' ]
console.log(numReverseCalls) // 7
```

## The `historyLength` option

The `historyLength` option is used to tell Signia how many diffs to store. Each time a value changes, a new diff is stored.

What you set this value to depends on how frequently the signal is read in relation to how often it changes.

- If it changes roughly as often as it is read, you can use a very low number.
- If it changes infrequently and is read frequently, you can also use a very low number.
- If it changes frequently and is read infrequently, you should use a higher number.

If you're not sure, I would suggest adding dev-time `console.warn` statements for when the `RESET_VALUE` constant is encountered. This will tell you that Signia doesn't have enough history to calculate the diff, and you should increase the `historyLength` option.

## The `computeDiff` option

If convenient, you can provide a `computeDiff` option along with the `historyLength` option when creating atoms or computed signals. Signia will use this so that you don't need to supply the diff when calling `Atom.set` or when returning from the compute function.

```ts
const names = atom('names', ['Bob', 'Alice'], {
	historyLength: 10,
	computeDiff: (prev, next) => {
		return produceWithPatches(prev, (draft) => {
			return next
		})[1]
	},
})
const startEpoch = names.lastChangedEpoch

names.set(['Bob', 'Abhiti'])
console.log(names.getDiffSince(startEpoch)) // [[ { op: 'replace', path: [1], value: 'Abhiti' } ]]
```

## Testing

Applying incremental diffs correctly takes a lot of care and can be difficult in unexpected ways.

We suggest using generative testing to make sure your incremental logic matches your non-incremental logic.

An easy way to get started is by creating a seeded random number generator and using it to generate random 'update ops' for atoms.
You can then run the same updates through both the incremental and non-incremental logic and compare the results.

```ts
const seed = Math.random()
test(`using seed ${seed}`, () => {
	const rng = new RandomNumberGenerator(seed)
	const names = new ImmerAtom('names', [], { historyLength: 10 })
	// if you set historyLength to 0 it will force your `map` incremental logic down the RESET_VALUE path
	const names_no_diff = new ImmerAtom('names_no_diff', [], { historyLength: 0 })

	const updateBoth = (fn: (draft: string[]) => void) => {
		names.update(fn)
		names_no_diff.update(fn)
	}

	const reversedNames = map(names, (name) => name.split('').reverse().join(''))
	const reversedNames_no_diff = map(names_no_diff, (name) => name.split('').reverse().join(''))

	for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
		// getRandomNamesOp implementation left as an exercise for the reader
		const op = getRandomNamesOp(names.state.value, rng)
		if (op.type === 'add_name') {
			updateBoth((draft) => {
				draft.splice(op.index, 0, op.name)
			})
		} else if (op.type === 'remove_name') {
			updateBoth((draft) => {
				draft.splice(op.index, 1)
			})
		} else if (op.type === 'update_name') {
			updateBoth((draft) => {
				draft[op.index] = op.name
			})
		}

		// don't check every time, to allow for some history buffer buildup and overflow
		if (rng.random() < 0.1) {
			expect(reversedNames.value).toEqual(reversedNames_no_diff.value)
		}
	}

	expect(reversedNames.value).toEqual(reversedNames_no_diff.value)
})
```

## Conclusion

Most complex software systems do _something_ along these lines by necessity, usually ad-hoc. The nice thing about integrating it into Signia is that it's now a first-class citizen and it works seamlessly with other signals. There's no need to worry about cache invalidation or update ordering, everything just works.

At [tldraw](https://tldraw.com) we use incrementally computed signals for a handful of our core data structures, and it's been a huge win for performance. We're able to keep our canvas snappy and responsive even when we have thousands of shapes.

We also have a rudimentary reactive database based on `signia` which makes heavy use of incrementally computed signals for building reactive queries and indexes.
